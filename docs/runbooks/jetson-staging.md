# Jetson Nano staging

The Jetson Nano is an ARM64 staging node, not a build host. CI builds the
application images once for `linux/arm64`, publishes them, and deploys the
resulting digests. The node only pulls images by digest and runs Compose.

Node services keep their runtime dependencies external to their ESM output.
This is required for OpenTelemetry's Node instrumentation, which uses dynamic
module loading and cannot run from an esbuild-bundled ESM artifact. Each
immutable image therefore contains the compiled service and its production
dependency tree.

## Network boundary

- Public WAN forwarding targets only Nginx on ports 80 and, after a domain and
  certificate are configured, 443.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, OTLP, Prometheus, Grafana and Portainer
  are private Docker-network services. The three management UIs bind to
  loopback and are accessed through Tailscale plus SSH tunnelling.
- The Nano is reachable in the tailnet as `phub-jetson-staging`.

## Bootstrap

1. Copy `deploy/jetson` to `/opt/phub` on the Nano.
2. Generate `/opt/phub/infrastructure.env` locally on the Nano. It contains
   only host secrets and resolved image digests; never commit it.
3. Validate and start the infrastructure:

   ```sh
   cd /opt/phub
   docker compose --env-file infrastructure.env -f compose.infrastructure.yaml config --quiet
   docker compose --env-file infrastructure.env -f compose.infrastructure.yaml up -d
   ```

4. Before application deployment, verify the backup destination and populate
   `/etc/phub/staging.env`. Run migrations once from the CI-published migrator
   digest, then deploy web, API, realtime and worker.

The staging application Compose file passes only the existing MinIO credentials from
`infrastructure.env` into the worker. API and realtime never receive object-storage credentials.
The worker uses the private `http://minio:9000` endpoint and publishes short-lived signed URLs
through the private `phub-media` bucket exposed by Nginx. The bucket is not public; unsigned reads
must remain denied.

## GitHub Actions access

GitHub-hosted runners reach the private Nano through the Tailscale action, not
through a public SSH forward. In the tailnet, create `tag:ci` and allow it to
reach `phub-jetson-staging:22`. On plans without Tailscale OAuth clients, use a
reusable, ephemeral 90-day auth key that is tagged `tag:ci`; rotate it before
expiry. Configure these GitHub environment `staging` secrets:

- `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` for the tagged, reusable, ephemeral Tailscale auth key;
- `STAGING_HOST=100.70.62.47`;
- `STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY`, the dedicated `phub-deploy` private key;
- `STAGING_KNOWN_HOSTS`, the Nano host key for `100.70.62.47`.

The staging workflow joins the tailnet as an ephemeral `tag:ci` node, verifies
the Nano with Tailscale ping, then uploads the digest-pinned release definition and the non-secret
public media endpoint.
It uses the job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` only through standard input to pull the
GHCR image digests and logs the Nano out of GHCR immediately afterward. Do not
create or store a long-lived registry token on the node.

After switching containers, the workflow waits until Docker reports API, realtime and worker
healthchecks as `healthy` before the public smoke test. The container healthchecks call each
process's private readiness endpoint, so the deploy gate does not depend on a second ad hoc command
inside a running container. If readiness does not converge, the workflow prints bounded startup
logs and container status, then fails the release instead of reporting an ambiguous Nginx `502`.

## Application ingress

Nginx stays healthy before the first application release. After a web release,
it serves the PadlHub SPA from `/` and falls back to `index.html` for client
routes. It also exposes these application routes:

- `/health` and `/health/*` to the API;
- `/user/api/*` to the API;
- `/realtime/*` to the realtime service, including WebSocket upgrades.

The web image is built in CI for `linux/arm64`, pinned by digest in the release
file, and served by an internal Nginx container. The Jetson never builds the
client and has no direct web-container port published. CI passes the deployed
commit SHA into the web build as `PHUB_RELEASE`; the post-deploy gate reads
`/manifest.json` through public ingress and requires its `release` field to
match the same GitHub commit before the release can succeed.

## Management access

With Tailscale connected, create local tunnels from the Mac:

```sh
ssh -N \
  -L 9443:127.0.0.1:9443 \
  -L 3101:127.0.0.1:3101 \
  -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 \
  phub-deploy@phub-jetson-staging
```

Then use `https://localhost:9443` for Portainer, `http://localhost:3101` for
Grafana and `http://localhost:9090` for Prometheus.

Swagger UI and Editor stay loopback-only as well: `http://localhost:18080` and
`http://localhost:18082`. UI request execution and authorization persistence
are disabled; Editor mounts a read-only copy of the contracts.
